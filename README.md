# Kali-Clean

My clone of xct's kali-clean repo for personal use. Goal is to create a Kali installer that works just the way I like it. Feel free to give it a try yourself :)  
> `install.sh` updates kali and installs a lot of stuff, so it will take a while.

## Installation
Just run this as the default kali user:
```
git clone https://github.com/jazzpizazz/kali-clean.git ~/tmp/kali-clean && cd ~/tmp/kali-clean && bash ./install.sh
```

After the script is done reboot and select i3 (top right corner) on the login screen. Then open a terminal (`ctrl+return`) run `lxappearance`and select ark-dark theme and change the icons to whatever you like (I used papyrus).

## Credits
All credits for the actual script and config go to [xct](https://github.com/xct) I just tweaked it for personal usage.
